Depending on your project and the types of data you will be using, your adviser might teach you different ways to load in your data. Some of us may use the [`glob` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) to accomplish the task above, for example. There are also lots of different file formats besides ASCII (plain human-readable text, such as `.dat` or `.txt`) or Numpy's `.npy`: some of us `pickle` our data, some of us use FITS files more often, and some of us save to `.csv` files.
