    "Python is one of many languages you can use for research and homework purposes. In the next few days, we will work through many of the tool, tips, and tricks that we as graduate students (and PhD researchers) use on a daily basis. We will NOT attempt to teach you all of Python as there isn't time. We will however build up a set of code(s) that will allow you to read and write data, make beautiful publish-worthy plots, fit a line (or any function) to data, and set up algorithms. You will also begin to learn the syntax of Python and can hopefuly apply this knowledge to your current and future work. "

    "A truth table is a way of showing the `True` and `False` values of different operations. This seems abstract and unuseful, but they can be really great ways to `mask`, or block out, data that is not needed. They typically start with values for two variables and then find the result when they are combined with different operators. Using two separate while-loops, generate two columns of a truth table for the lists `x` and `y`, defined below. That is, find the values for each element in the list for `x and y` in one loop and then the values of `x or y` in another. Note: you can always check your answer by doing it in your head! Checking your work is a good habit to have for the future :)"
